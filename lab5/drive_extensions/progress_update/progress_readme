What I am doing so far.

I cloned the ros-navigation stack from here.
	https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/tree/indigo-devel
I am trying to learn what we can do with it using. 
	-bagfiles and maps from https://www.dropbox.com/home/gmapping.
	
	-To play a map run rosrun map_server map_server file.yawl
	-To play a bagfile rosbag play file
	-I am experimenting with move_base, local_base_planner, global_base_planner, and costmaps.
	

Here are some screenshots I have taken.
	-> The car tranform is weird and the position is jumping around.
	->https://www.dropbox.com/home/gmapping/nav_stack_%20experiment

We need a record of the car tf_static on the bagfile to git usefull information.

I started a few hours ago and haven't yet concentrated on it.
	-> I am going to work on it for a while tonight

Cloning and using package from github.
	->create a workspace or in an existing worksapace
		->clone the package
		->run catkin_make on the workspace directory
		->if not successfull try resolving dependencies by running rosdep install --from-paths ~/workspace/src/
